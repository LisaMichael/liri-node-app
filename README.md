###### LIRI


In order to meet the Employer Competitive standards and be ready to show your application to employers, the `README.md` file should meet the following criteria:

1. Clearly state the problem the app is trying to solve (i.e. what is it doing and why)

INTRODUCTION
In this assignment, I created an application called LIRI. LIRI is simlar to the iPhone's SIRI application.  

While SIRI is an acronym for "Speech Interpretation and Recogition Interface", LIRI is a "Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface".

2. Give a high-level overview of how the app is organized
LIRI is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application developed using Node.js.

LIRI was developed using NPMs, often referred to the "Node Package Manager". The NPMs contained in LIRI include: moment.js, Axios, fs and node-spotify-api. 

The Axios NPM is used to connect, query, and retrieve data responses using APIs from 3 specific websites:
i) Bandsintown.com 
ii) spotify.com
iii) omdbapi.com (The Open Movie Database)

The response data is then displayed using commands from the command line.


3. Give start-to-finish instructions on how to run the app
4. Include screenshots, gifs or videos of the app functioning
5. Contain a link to a deployed version of the app
6. Clearly list the technologies used in the app
7. State your role in the app development
